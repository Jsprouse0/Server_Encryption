SERVER ENCRYPTION: 
The server/client encryption uses 3 AES modes, ECB, CBC, and OFB. To run these you must download the files and run them in an IDE, I will update this to work on the command line so it is less of a hassle to show, but for now, the modes work fine and will encrypt or decrypt any of the three modes.
